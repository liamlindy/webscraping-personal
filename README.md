This has a few files that allow for webscraping practices. 

## How Web Scraping Works
- the foundation is Beautiful Soup (```bs4``` in python), which essentially scrapes the HTML tags out of a website or static HTML files. 
- If we want to scrape out on the open internet ```selenium``` is the package that is used. 
   - ```selenium``` used in conjunction with Beautiful Soup allows us to parse HTML out of websites and effectively crawl them or spider through them.
